# Research Projects
## First Year Engineering Student Use of Prototyping Strategies - IDREEM Lab – Fall 2025 <br>
**Focus:** Engineering Design, Self-Efficacy, Undergraduate Research Assistant <br>
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Statistical analysis <br>
**Outcome:** Investigate how different prototyping strategies affect first-year engineering students’ design outcomes. Specifically, it examines the impact of parallel versus iterative design exposure in a task where students designed 3D printed devices to launch a ball 10 feet into a target. The goal is to better understand how prototyping methods influence the design process, exploration of the possible design space, and students’ confidence in their approach.


# Course Projects

## Predicting Mechanical Properties of Polyurethane Elastomers based on Published Paper- Fall 2025
**Focus:** Machine Learning; Data analysis & Model Implementation <br>
**Tools:** Python, Statistical analysis, Machine Learning, Data visualization <br>
**Outcome:** Attempt to identify key factors influencing mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers. 
Gaussian Process Regression model, despite challenges like sparse sampling and non-nomral data distributions 
for the paper's supplied dataset, was able to predict mechanical porperties with relative accruacy. Not sufficiently sampled 
for high-dimensional analysis, but non-normality and multicollinearity was confirmed with Statistical Data analysis. 

## Automotive Electronics Keyless Car and Security Group Research Paper - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Control Systems and Simulations <br>
**Tools:** MATLAB, System dynamics <br>
**Outcome:** Comparison of Keyless Car System Technology Strengths and Weaknesses from Engineer and Consumer standpoints. 

## Automotive Electronics Keyless Car and Security Group Research Paper - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Automotive Electronics & Securiy System Analysis <br>
**Tools:** Bosch Automotive Resources <br>
**Outcome:** In-depth comparison of keyless car systems, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses from both engineering and 
consumer standpoints. Identified vulnerabilites and usability concerns, presented in a compherensive report and presentation.

## Statistical Inference for Material Tensile Strength Testing - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Statistical Quality Control <br>
**Tools:** MATLAB, Statistical Analysis <br>
**Outcome:** Simulation of data collection used to produce estimates and confidence intervals to complete hypothesis testing.

## Elevator simulation system operated by DC motor and Computer stability problem - Fall 2024
**Focus:** Control Systems and Simulations <br>
**Tools:** MATLAB, System dynamics <br>
**Outcome:** Equivalent Transfer functions and system steady-state trajectories found and graphically demonstrated. 
Stability of results and step-responses confirmed.

## Task-completing Autonomous Robot - Spring 2024
**Focus:** Mechanical Design & Control  <br>
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Arduino, C++ <br>
**Outcome:** Collaboratively designed and built a task-completing robot using Solidworks and mechatronics integration. 
Implemented C++ sensor communication on Arduino Uno to enable autonomous operation within time constraints. 
Presented design rationale, CAD renderings, and performance analysis to faculty and industry evaluators.

## Hypothetical Lunar Rover Suspension system - Fall 2023
**Focus:** Programming  <br>
**Tools:** MATLAB, Numerical Methods <br>
**Outcome:** Optimized conditions and created models for a hypothetical lunar rover suspension system. 
Given design parameters and specifications, compared the output of analytical,linear and non-linear mass-spring-damper systems at different frequencies and tested convergence.
