# Course Projects

## Predicting Mechanical Properties of Polyurethane Elastomers based on Published Paper- Fall 2025
**Focus:** Machine Learning; Data analysis & Model Implementation 
**Tools:** Python, Statistical analysis, Machine Learning, Data visualization
**Outcome:** Attempt to identify key factors influencing mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers. 
Gaussian Process Regression model, despite challenges like sparse sampling and non-nomral data distributions 
for the paper's supplied dataset, was able to predict mechanical porperties with relative accruacy. Not sufficiently sampled 
for high-dimensional analysis, but non-normality and multicollinearity was confirmed with Statistical Data analysis. 

## Automotive Electronics Keyless Car and Security Group Research Paper - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Control Systems and Simulations
**Tools:** MATLAB, System dynamics
**Outcome:** Comparison of Keyless Car System Technology Strengths and Weaknesses from Engineer and Consumer standpoints. 

## Automotive Electronics Keyless Car and Security Group Research Paper - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Automotive Electronics & Securiy System Analysis
**Tools:** Bosch Automotive Resources 
**Outcome:** In-depth comparison of keyless car systems, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses from both engineering and 
consumer standpoints. Identified vulnerabilites and usability concerns, presented in a compherensive report and presentation.

## Statistical Inference for Material Tensile Strength Testing - Spring 2025
**Focus:** Statistical Quality Control and 
**Tools:** MATLAB, Statistical Analysis
**Outcome:** Simulation of data collection used to produce estimates and confidence intervals to complete hypothesis testing.

## Elevator simulation system operated by DC motor and Computer stability problem - Fall 2024
**Focus:** Control Systems and Simulations
**Tools:** MATLAB, System dynamics
**Outcome:** Equivalent Transfer functions and system steady-state trajectories found and graphically demonstrated. 
Stability of results and step-responses confirmed.

## Task-completing Autonomous Robot - Spring 2024
**Focus:** Mechanical Design & Control  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Arduino, C++
**Outcome:** Collaboratively designed and built a task-completing robot using Solidworks and mechatronics integration. 
Implemented C++ sensor communication on Arduino Uno to enable autonomous operation within time constraints. 
Presented design rationale, CAD renderings, and performance analysis to faculty and industry evaluators.

## Hypothetical Lunar Rover Suspension system - Fall 2023
**Focus:** Programming  
**Tools:** MATLAB, Numerical Methods
**Outcome:** Optimized conditions and created models for a hypothetical lunar rover suspension system. 
Given design parameters and specifications, compared the output of analytical,linear and non-linear mass-spring-damper systems at different frequencies and tested convergence.  

## Culture-Inspired Home Decor - Spring 2023
**Focus:** Design and Manufacturing
**Tools:** Solidworks, 3D Printing
**Outcome:** Produced multi-view and sectional CAD drawings, thumbnail sketches, and assemblies both by hand and via CAD.<br>
Considered GD&T and fit parameters when 3D printing end result.
