# Alba Garcia-Sarabia
I’m a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Tech with interests in mechatronics, system dynamics, and engineering design. I enjoy building and analyzing integrated systems and am experienced in CAD-driven design, system modeling, and mechatronic system implementation. I bring a global perspective shaped by an engineering exchange at Universidad Pontificia Comillas (ICAI) in Madrid and a faculty-led first-year study abroad based in Oxford with travel across Europe. Bilingual in English and Spanish, I’m motivated by technically rigorous, collaborative engineering problems.
