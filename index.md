# Alba Garcia-Sarabia
I’m a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Tech with interests in mechatronics, system dynamics, and engineering design. I have hands-on experience designing and implementing integrated systems using CAD, system modeling, and mechatronic control, as well as applying machine learning to engineering modeling and decision-making. I bring a global perspective shaped by an engineering exchange in Madrid (ICAI) and Oxford with travel across Europe. Bilingual in English and Spanish, I’m motivated by technically rigorous, collaborative engineering problems and enjoy creating practical, innovative solutions
