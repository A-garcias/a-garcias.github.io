# Predicting Mechanical Properties of Polyurethane Elastomers based on Published Paper
This folder will contain all Python scripts, data, and plots relating to this project. 

Table 2 and 3 come from the published paper, and are not my own results, but are data necessary to re-run the code. Data Analysis is Part 1, MLSel (Model Selection) is Part 2.
