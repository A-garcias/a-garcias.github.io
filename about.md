# About Me

My name is Alba Garcia-Sarabia, and I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology with interests in mechatronics, system dynamics, and engineering design. My academic and project experience focuses on modeling and understanding how physical systems behave, integrating mechanical components with sensing and computation, and making informed design decisions under uncertainty. I have hands-on experience with CAD-driven design, dynamic system modeling, numerical methods, and mechatronic system implementation, applying these skills in both individual and collaborative projects to create functional, innovative systems. I have also applied machine learning techniques to support engineering modeling, prediction, and system-level decision-making.<br>

I’ve also studied engineering in international settings through an exchange at Universidad Pontificia Comillas (ICAI) in Madrid and a Georgia Tech faculty-led first-year study abroad program based in Oxford. These experiences, along with my bilingual background in English and Spanish, have shaped my approach to collaboration, communication, and system-level engineering problem-solving.
